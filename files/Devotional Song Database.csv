"Who am I? Who's behind these eyes?
If I am not this body, who am I?
Who am I? Who's the one inside?
If I am not my mind, then who am I?
The message is: to look within ourselves, for
truth to be revealed. We ask, we search, we pray
Who am I? Who's the ""I"" inside? If I am not my feelings, who am I?
Behind each thought, there always is the ""I"";
if I am not my thoughts, than who am I?
The message is: to look within ourselves, for truth to be revealed.
We ask, ""Where does this 'I' come from?"" (3X)
Who am I? Who's behind my mind? If I am not my ego, who am I?
Beyond this ""I"", who projects the ""I""?
The answer comes by asking, ""Who am I?""
We seek the source from which the mind springs.
We ask, we search, we pray. (2X)
But then it's not by doing, but only by being, that
the final discovery is made.

Rama Rama Ram, Rama Rama Ram, Sai Rama Rama Ram
Great Is The Power Of The Name, Burning Our Sin And Sorrow
Helping Us Live Without The Fear Of What May Happen Tomorrow
Saying The Name Will Bring Eternal Peace And Happiness
Comforting When We Need Support, It Helps In Times Of Distress
Saying The Name Will Give Protection; Worries And Doubts Will Cease
When We Call, Wherever We Are, The Name Will Give Us Peace
Rama's Name Is Father And Mother, It Is Our Dearest Friend
We Have No Need Of Any Other, On Ram We Can Depend

"Without Singing To The Lord, There's No Peace Or Happiness

Without Serving Mankind, No Salvation Can There Be
Without Singing To The Lord, There's No Peace Or Happiness
We Find Union With Him When Our Minds Are At Rest
The Best Wisdom Is Seeing The Lord Everywhere
The Most Righteous Of Deeds Shows Compassion And Care
There Is No One As Near And As Dear As The Lord
He Is Present In All And In All Can Be Adored
